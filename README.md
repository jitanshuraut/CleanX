# ``` Abstract ```

Due to rapid development and industrialisation, dustbin proves to be an effective way to handle garbage and thus, is of pristine importance when it comes to deploy a healthy environment. This project highlights on the need of garbage collection and it’s required for the healthy environment maintenance. The project works as an effective medium for the same and deals with the information about the location of a dustbin in the nearby areas provides a functionality of getting the nearby areas clean too. It’s based on a simple interface which acts as a user-friendly application for hands on experience of users of all age groups. The legend helps in identifying which areas are in dustbin zone and garbage disposal after collection of all the ruckus prevalent. The website tries to cover all aspects related to waste management and also believes in the adage that health is wealth. 


# ```Introduction```

## 1.1 Vision:
We envision alike our honourable Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s aspiration to establish our country as a clean and green city in order to abstain the transmission of any kind of future contagious microorganism and make our city a better place to reside. As if continue to exploit our surroundings in a way that we are doing today recklessly, a day is undoubtedly prophesized that the nature will toll back so brutally that not a single living thing will sustain itself. Building our country, a better place to thrive is not only our prime responsibility but our duty for our posterity who wouldn’t be able to cope with the trauma that holds for them due to our preposterous habits. Perhaps if we assiduously pledge to exempt ourselves from throwing litter here and there, something will remain for our next generations to experience! 

## 1.2 Solution:
So having said that we’ve aimed to design a prototype of the same: CLEANEX: cleaning.exe; or in other words setting up a permanent file of cleaning in the most efficient of the drives or our minds. Propelling the initiative requires mass participation, so whenever you vaguely observe any kind of waste thing lying on ground, don’t think twice before you place it in the dustbins located nearest to your location.
Our project, CLEANEX deals with the effective management of the ruckus people create when they unthinkably litter here and there in spite of being aware of the fact that how injurious it might be for our nature. We, as responsible citizens of our country have vowed to make our city a better place to live in. We wanted to enlighten the rural about the same too. 

## 1.3 Dustbins serving as an effective medium:
Dustbins serve as an effective medium to get rid of the nasty litter with ease so to maintain cleanliness and sanctity of our environment, we’ve come up with the idea of placing dustbins in every nook of the city, Surat, we haven’t left even the outskirts of our city dirty. And to make it easier for even the common pupils of the city, we’ve provided them with an easy to use interface which they are well aware of. 
Regular maintenance of the dustbins, our reliable and competent workers will be taking care of the overloading of the dustbins everyday after the onset of night so that a day after this there will be no conundrum regarding which dustbin is yet to get loaded or not. Whenever a dustbin is somehow demolished maybe via any of the external factors, the user can quickly contact to out helpline number and we’ll accordingly get back to him but prior to that we’ll deactivate the icon in that locality so that no one gets false information.
